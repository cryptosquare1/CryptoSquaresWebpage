    <p style="text-align: center;">Decoding the compressed CryptoSquare DNA is
      simple ...really simple, but this simple compression saves memory and
      therefore gas on the ethereum blockchain and allows everybody to verify
      the appearance of a token ...Let´s explain:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">A row with 4 columns and 4 different possible
      colors in each tile has 24 (4*3*2*1) possibilities. So each row in a
      CryptoSquare can have 24 different combinations. We mapped each
      combination to a capital letter (A-X). It´s the same order as in the
      overview #000 token. Btw. did you notice that in every of the 24 rows of
      CryptoSquares in the overview token, each CryptoSquare starts with the
      same row of tiles?</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">OK, after defining these rows, you can
      identify each CryptoSquare by the capital letters mapped to their first 3
      rows (row 4 is evident and therefore redundant). CryptoSquare_#001 for
      example is defined by "AHQ". And thats the DNA defined for each
      CryptoSquare and stored on-chain together with the design blueprint in the
      contract. </p>
