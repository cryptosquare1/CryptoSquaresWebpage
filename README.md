Looking for a unique and beautiful NFT? Tired of complex, expensive and weird NFT schemes? Searching a real unique NFT ?

→ Just have a look at CryptoSquares!


A CryptoSquare is a Square with 4 rows and 4 columns resulting in 16 tiles in 4 different colors. These 4 rows, 4 columns and 4 colors (blue, green, red and yellow) resulting in over 4 Billion (= 4.294.967.296) possible combinations. Out of these 4 Billion possibilities,  the CryptoSquares algorithm found 576 Squares containing in each row AND in each column all 4 different colors. Only these 576 Squares are minted and numbered as CryptoSquares and living in the blockchain metaverse. Have a look and get your favorite number and/or color pattern.

SOON!!!

And that´s it!

No clubs, no bored apes, no crypto punks, no kitties and especially no lame copies or clones of the mentioned before, no schemes or weird promises ... just art and fun!

Just one more thing:

We believe a NFT should be as much as possible defined via the contract on the blockchain. Decentrally stored and cryptocally hashed metadata is an elegant solution for on-chain performance and memory restrictions and we use these of course too, but just minting an empty and featureless token and define just via metadata if it is an ape, a punk, a CryptoSquare and which CryptoSquare just feels wrong.

So we decided to add the CryptoSquares Blueprint and the DNA for each and ever CryptoSquare into the contract. With these informations everybody could verify and rebuild a CryptoSquare.

Don´t get us wrong, we know the advantages of metadata linking and therefore we also added an overview CryptoSquare_#000 which metadata image contains all of the 576 CryptoSquares images. Again to make it easy for everybody to verify a specific token.
